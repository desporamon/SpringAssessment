# SpringBoot Assessment
## Creating a Todo list
Our job was to build a full-stack To-do list application using Java and the Spring Boot framework, while also building out the front-end with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Features
1)	Show all Todo list : Create a web page to display all Todo lists. The table will list out all the information for the Todo list. Information to be retrieved from MySQL database.
2)	Add Todo list: Create a web page to allow users to add their Todo list. The form allows users to enter their Todo list details. When users click on the ‘Add’ button, the newly entered information will be added to the MySQL database. 

#### What did you like about this project?
This projects gives me a chances to properly revisit the Spring Framework as well as better understand the Spring Boot flow architecture. While completing this assessment with the use of Jean's videos. I better understood how the backend is created with the use of SpringBoot i.e.
- Model - model component is used to map the database (relational mapping)
- service layer - provides services/ methods as required by controller
- Controller - to get HTTP requests from client and then call the different service nethods accordingly. Inside the controller itself, need to create a class known as - Item DTO (Data Transfer Object)
- Java Persistence API Concepts (JPA)
- Concept of Dependency Injection (DI) - i.e. ItemServiceSQL class object needs to depend on ItemRepository Interface to perform actions, therefore need to "inject" the item repository object to the ItemServiceMySQL class object

#### What did you struggle with in this project?
- The concepts taught in class were too much, impossible to comprehend all information/resources with everything that was taught in less than 5 days. Appreciated the concepts taught to give us a big picture to understand the flow architecture properly. Finally enlightened to see how the front end is connect to backend and how to setup database connection. Would have appreciated if we were given more time to digest and do up our own notes properly for self-understanding. 
- Without the videos and the demo web project by Jean, it will be an even bigger struggle.
- I am a visual person who needs to understand the big picture and the flow architecture instead of jumping right into coding. 

#### What would make your experience with this assessment better?
- I am glad we were given an assessment which was similar to the demo web project to give us a better chance to reinforce the concepts taught in class.
- Sufficient time was given for the assessment but the time we have for assessment preparation is too little.
